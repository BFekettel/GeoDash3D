# GeoDash 3D

A C++ 3D port of the popular game Geometry Dash.

---

## ðŸ“„ Document Purpose
This README documents the project as a whole â€” essentially a timeline and record of objectives, intentions, and how execution unfolded.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
The goal for the project is to re-create the popular game **Geometry Dash** using the **OpenGL API** with **C++**, putting into practice the skills and knowledge gained during university.

This project is intended as a **portfolio piece**, not a finished commercial product. Itâ€™s a showcase of skills in **software** and **game development**.

---

## ðŸ›  Technical Goals
The technical aim is to use **advanced low-level programming techniques** to build a product that others can extend and modify.

**Other outcomes:**
- Deeper understanding and use of Graphics APIs.
- A technical showcase of low-level programming skills.
- Demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming paradigms, design patterns, and optimisations.
- Provide developers with the ability to clone and expand the project.

**Software Tools:**
- **C++ 20**
- **GLAD** / **GLFW** libraries
- **CLion** IDE
- **GitHub** for version control

**Inspiration:** Many of the system designs (components, events, objects, etc.) take inspiration from **Unreal Engine**.

## ðŸŽ® Initial Game Outline
**GeoDash3D** takes heavy inspiration from *Geometry Dash*.  

**Core loop:**
- Guide the playerâ€™s character through platforms and obstacles to the levelâ€™s end.
- The character moves automatically â€” the player only controls jumps.
- The initial development goal is to replicate this loop with a cube character.

## ðŸ§© Initial Working Prototype Requirements

### Player (Cube Character)
- Jump on button input.
- Automatically move forward.
- Collision detection prevents falling through floors.
- Collision with objects:
  - If colliding front-on with most objects â†’ reset level.
  - If colliding with spikes â†’ instant reset.
- Winning condition when reaching the levelâ€™s end (display a win screen).

### Objects & Obstacles
- **Walls/Floors:** Player can stand on top but not pass through front-on.
- **Spikes:** Destroy the player on any collision.
- **Bounce Pads:** Launch the player higher than a normal jump.

### Level Editor
- In-game editor to create custom levels with built-in objects/obstacles.
- Save levels as `.G3D` binary files.
- Main menu allows loading levels via file explorer into the gameâ€™s directory.
- Option to edit loaded levels.

### Main Menu
- **Play** â†’ opens level select menu.
- **Level Editor** â†’ open editor mode.
- **Load Level** â†’ load `.G3D` files.

### Level Select Menu
- Displays all loaded levels with preview thumbnails.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- This document outlines a **prototype**; the final product will expand beyond this.
- More features and details will be added as development progresses.
